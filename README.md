#Rug Pull Detection Feature Documentation
#Overview

#Rug pull detection is a critical feature of Rabble that helps users identify high-risk projects in the blockchain ecosystem. This feature analyzes transaction patterns and pool creations to flag suspicious activities and provide actionable insights to mitigate risks.

#Workflow
The rug pull detection process involves the following steps:

#Transaction Pattern Analysis

#Rabble scans the blockchain for transaction patterns involving similar accounts.
If similar accounts are identified, it examines receiving and granting transactions to detect matching amounts.
Fake Pool Identification

#Rabble inspects liquidity pools to detect fake pool creation attempts, which often signal rug pull risks.
Risk Assessment

#If suspicious transaction patterns or fake pools are found, the project is flagged as high-risk.
Otherwise, it is marked as low-risk.
Report Generation

A comprehensive report is generated, summarizing the analysis and providing a risk classification.

#Features
Transaction Pattern Scanning: Detects linked accounts with suspicious transaction behaviors.
Fake Pool Detection: Identifies pools created to mislead investors.
Risk Flagging: Projects are flagged as low-risk or high-risk based on detected anomalies.
Detailed Reports: Users receive actionable reports for informed decision-making.
